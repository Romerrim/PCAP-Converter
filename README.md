# PCAP-Converter
A script that converts PCAP files to HCCAPX using hashcat-utils, then attempts to decrypt using all wordlists in a specified folder.

# Usage
This was written with learning scripting for new users in mind, there are better and faster ways to do this. The script is fully commented and walks new users thru what each command or set of commands is doing, it does work to decrypt wifi handshakes, but the intended purpose is to aid in learning scripting.
